# Data Sense

The purpose of this project is to develop a Python app, named Data Sense, that can analyze the sales data of the food industry stored in a Remote Database. The app provides both visual and numeric analysis of the data and offers a GUI interface for users to access and analyze the data directly from the Remote Database in fraction of time.

## Libraries and APIs Used

The app utilizes the following libraries and APIs:

- ***oauth2client*** module to authorize the user to the Google Database.
- ***Google Drive API*** and ***Google Sheets API*** to create a link between the user and the Google Sheet.
- ***gspread*** module to access the sales data from the Remote Database.
- ***NumPy*** for performing numerical analysis on the data.
- ***Matplotlib*** for creating graphs and visualizations of the data.
- ***requests*** library, ***Python Image Library (PIL)***, and ***Input/Output(io)*** library for GUI enhancement and data handling.
- ***SecuriPy***, a library developed by the app's developer, for security-related functionalities.

## Features Offered
1. **Accountability** for safe and secure access to big data. The app offers a safe and secure account management system with encrypted credential storage to security.

5. **AI-Based** Suggestions of Analysis: The app is integrated with AI to provide suggestions based on the analysis of the sales data to enhance production and sales.
6. **Data export**: The app allows users to export the analyzed data in various formats, such as:
   - Graphs: **JPEG, PNG.**
   - Selected Data: **CSV, ANY SPREADSHEET.**

The expected outcomes may be one of the following:

1. A graph plotted based on the selected parameters.
2. Numeric data corresponding to the analysis performed.
3. Quick suggestions based on the analysis.

Example Visual Output is:
